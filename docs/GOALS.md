complete:
* define starter ISA (gotta finish this)
* add functionality for flags to be set on arithmetic operations
* implement debugger stuff to make testing easier
* once all opcodes and flags are set, do some testing (figure out how to do testing in c++?)
* ambitious, but once that is done move onto implementing an assembler so we can give it to people and have it work better
* even more ambitious, maybe try and build a simple high level language that we can use in our system

## Program Loader
Will need to add a functionality for:
* Reading in a program (done)
* Load that program into memory (done) 
* Begin execution of program (done)
